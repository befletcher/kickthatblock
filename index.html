				<p>What's keeping you from finishing that book or screenplay?</p>

				<p>Could it be WRITER’S BLOCK – the neurotic cage that imprisons our artistic dreams?</p>

				<p>It’s happened to the best of writers...but you can break free!</p>

				<p>Veteran Atlanta writer and teacher Doug Monroe offers KICK THAT BLOCK, a fascinating and entertaining day-long seminar that helps writers see what’s holding them back and find ways to finish the projects they’ve kept locked up for far too long.</p>

				<p>Doug’s KICK THAT BLOCK seminar will be offered in June at Hollis Gillespie’s wildly successful SHOCKING REAL LIFE Writing Academy at Atlantic Station in Midtown Atlanta.</p>

				<p>Date:</p> 

				<p>Cost:</p>

				<p>Seminar students will explore the psychological roots of writer’s block, a term coined by the controversial Austrian psychoanalyst Edmund Bergler, author of "The Writer and Psychoanalysis."</p>

				<p>We’ll also examine famous cases of writer’s block through the film "Joe Gould’s Secret" and the newly published biography of one of America’s most notoriouslyblocked writers: "Man in Profile: Joseph Mitchell of the New Yorker."</p>

				<p>Doug Monroe has been a professional writer since 1971 and has written popular columns for the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Creative Loafing and Atlanta Magazine. He’s also been a New York City Teaching Fellow and has taught writing at the University of Georgia and Georgia College and State University. He has won state, regional and national awards for his writing. For more information, check him out at <a href-"http://www.dougmonroe.com">www.dougmonroe.com</a></p>
